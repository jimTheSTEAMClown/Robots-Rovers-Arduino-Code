# Bluetooth Stuff
Hi, this is the start of a Bluetooth Repository of examples to get simple to complex design running on an Arduino

## Simple Bluetooth Parser - Serial Bluetooth Terminal & a HC-06 Bluetooth board connect to an Arduino
The first example is for running a Bluetooth Arduino design that is a Simple Parser.  It takes the output from a Bluetooth app like Serial Bluetooth Terminal, and a HC-06 Bluetooth board.
